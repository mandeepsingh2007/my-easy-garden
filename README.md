🌱 My Easy Garden – Accessible Urban Gardening

Empowering elderly and specially-abled individuals to connect with nature, improve well-being, and grow their own food.

🌍 The Problem

Urban gardening can be challenging for elderly and specially-abled individuals due to:

🚶‍♂️ Mobility Issues: Difficulty with bending, lifting, or fine motor tasks.

🧠 Cognitive Load: Overwhelming instructions in existing gardening apps.

🏙️ Inaccessible Environments: Limited spaces like balconies or windowsills.

📱 Low Digital Literacy: Complex app interfaces that feel intimidating.

These barriers reduce independence, limit physical activity, and create a disconnect from nature.
